# Hi! I'm Vu Tran
I started out as graduate with Computer Science and Finance background. I have always been curious with how data and numbers explain the problems in our daily life. I love to come up with solutions backed up with the facts and communicate those solutions effectively.

I'm passionate about detangle complicated patterns into clear models. Data cleaning is part of the job that I enjoy performing. As a Data Analyst, I always strive to improve my skills in both data analytics and business communications.

I am currently looking for challenges and opportunities in roles as either Data Analyst or Business Intelligence Analyst.
