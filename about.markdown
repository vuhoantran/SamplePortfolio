# Hi! I'm Vu Tran
I started out with background in Computer Science and Finance. I have always been curious with how data and numbers explain the problems in our daily life. I love to come up with solutions backed up with the facts and communicate those solutions effectively.

I'm passionate about detangling complicated patterns into clear models. Data cleaning and exploration are parts of the job that I enjoy performing. As a Data Analyst, I always strive to improve my skills in both data analytics and business communications.

I am currently looking for challenges and opportunities in roles as either Data Analyst or Business Intelligence Analyst.
